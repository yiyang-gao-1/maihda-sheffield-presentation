### 📊 Presentation Overview

This presentation showcases how MAIHDA transforms our understanding of educational inequalities through three innovative applications:

1. **Spatial MAIHDA**: Revealing intersectional patterns in school segregation
2. **Longitudinal MAIHDA**: Identifying career crisis points in teacher retention
3. **Policy Evaluation MAIHDA**: Quantifying differential impacts of transport policies

### 🎯 Key Features

- **10 interactive slides** demonstrating MAIHDA's transformative potential
- **Three empirical studies** each extending MAIHDA in novel directions
- **Monte Carlo simulations** for uncertainty quantification
- **Visual demonstrations** of intersectional inequalities
- **Policy-relevant findings** for targeted interventions

### 📑 Presentation Content

#### Study 1: School Segregation (Spatial MAIHDA)
- **Question**: Which students experience educational segregation?
- **Innovation**: Individual-level analysis with spatial clustering
- **Key Finding**: Pakistani low-SES boys have 71.2% probability of attending segregated schools
- **Publication**: Population, Space and Place (forthcoming)

#### Study 2: Teacher Retention (Longitudinal MAIHDA)
- **Question**: Which teachers leave and when?
- **Innovation**: Time-varying intersectional trajectories
- **Key Finding**: Black male non-ITT teachers face Year 2 crisis (HR = 2.8)
- **Publication**: Research Papers in Education (under review)

#### Study 3: Transport Policy (Policy Evaluation MAIHDA)
- **Question**: Who benefits from free school transport?
- **Innovation**: Differential policy impact analysis
- **Key Finding**: 42% take-up for Pakistani families vs 78% for White families
- **Status**: Grant application with Department of Sociology, Durham
