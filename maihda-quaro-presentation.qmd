# What is MAIHDA? {background-color="#f0f0f0"}

**Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy**

::: {.callout-note}
**The "Gold Standard" for Quantitative Intersectional Analysis**

Treats intersectional identities as random effects in multilevel models, revealing how multiple characteristics combine to create unique experiences beyond simple additive effects
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Conventional Approach:**

- Examines factors separately
- Assumes additive effects
- Misses critical intersections
- Generic policy recommendations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**MAIHDA Approach:**

- Creates intersectional strata
- Reveals multiplicative effects
- Handles small cell sizes via shrinkage
- Enables targeted interventions
:::
::::

::: {.callout-warning}
**Three Extended MAIHDA Applications:**

1. Spatial MAIHDA → School Segregation Study
2. Longitudinal MAIHDA → Teacher Retention Study
3. Policy Evaluation MAIHDA → Transport & Accessibility Study
:::

# Study 1: Educational Segregation {background-color="#7B3F99"}

## Current Approach: Limitations {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Research Question
Which students experience educational segregation, and how does this vary across space and time?

::: {.callout-tip}
**Current Aggregate Approach:**

- **Calculates:** Segregation indices by ethnicity and area
- **Shows:** Overall levels of ethnic concentration in schools
- **Misses:** Which specific students attend segregated schools
- **Cannot reveal:** Intersectional vulnerabilities
:::

### Current Method

- Aggregate segregation indices
- Treats ethnic groups as homogeneous
- Cannot identify individual risk factors
- Misses within-group heterogeneity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Segregation Paradox
Aggregate data shows decreasing segregation, but which students still experience it?

::: {style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;"}
**Who Attends Segregated Schools?**
Current methods can't answer:

- Are Pakistani boys more affected than Pakistani girls?
- Does social class intersect with ethnicity?
- Where do vulnerable groups cluster?
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
**Definition of Segregated School:**
Schools where >70% of students are from a single ethnic group (following Burgess & Wilson, 2005)
:::
:::
::::

::: {.callout-important}
**Limitation**

Aggregate approaches hide intersectional experiences - we need individual-level analysis to understand WHO experiences segregation, not just HOW MUCH segregation exists
:::

## Spatial MAIHDA Enhancement {.smaller}

**Individual-Level Spatial MAIHDA Innovation**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Method Enhancement:

- **Unit:** Individual students (N = 3.2 million)
- **Outcome:** Attends segregated school (binary)
- **24 intersectional strata:** Ethnicity × SES × Gender
- **Cross-classified** with spatial units (LSOAs)
- **Monte Carlo:** 10,000 simulations

$$\text{logit}(Y_{ijk}) = \gamma_0 + u_{0j}[\text{strata}] + v_{0k}[\text{LSOA}] + W \cdot \text{spatial\_effects}$$

**Key Innovation:** Reveals WHO is most likely to experience segregation, not just WHERE segregation exists
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Probability of Attending Segregated School:

| Intersectional Group | Probability | Odds Ratio |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Pakistani × Low SES × Female | 68.4% | 3.24 [2.89-3.61] |
| Pakistani × Low SES × Male | 71.2% | 3.57 [3.18-3.99] |
| White × High SES × Female | 21.1% | Reference |
| Black × Low SES × Male | 52.3% | 2.48 [2.21-2.78] |

::: {style="background-color: #e6f3ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;"}
**Discriminatory Accuracy:** ICC = 0.15  
85% of variation is within intersectional groups - context matters more than identity alone
:::

```

::: {.callout-important}
**Critical Finding**

Monte Carlo reveals Pakistani low-SES boys have 71.2% [95% CI: 68.4%-73.8%] probability of attending segregated schools, with strong spatial clustering (Moran's I = 0.82) in specific urban areas. This intersectional vulnerability was invisible in aggregate analyses.

## Current Approach: Tracking the 2011 Cohort {.smaller}

**Traditional Survival Analysis**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Current Method Limitations:

- Cox model with additive effects
- Assumes: ethnicity + gender + ITT = risk
- Misses intersectional experiences
- Cannot identify time-specific vulnerabilities

::: {.callout-tip}
**Hidden Variation:**
Overall retention rates mask huge differences:

- **Female:** 16.54% - but ranges from 8% to 24% by intersectional group
- **No ITT:** 9.75% - but some groups retain at 18%, others at 3%

**But which teachers struggle most?**
:::
::::

::: {.callout-important}
**Critical Limitation**

These aggregate curves hide intersectional vulnerabilities. A Black male teacher without ITT in London has a fundamentally different trajectory than a White female teacher with ITT in rural areas - but current analysis treats them as parts of separate, additive categories.
:::

## Longitudinal MAIHDA Enhancement {.smaller}

**Revealing Intersectional Career Trajectories**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Longitudinal MAIHDA Innovation:

- **200 intersectional strata:** Ethnicity × Gender × ITT × Region
- **Time-varying hazards:** Captures non-linear career patterns
- **Individual trajectories:** Random slopes for each stratum
- **Critical periods:** Statistically identified vulnerability windows

$$\text{logit}(\text{leaving}) \sim \text{poly}(\text{year}, 2) + (\text{poly}(\text{year}, 2) | \text{strata}) + (1|\text{school}) + (1|\text{teacher})$$

::: {style="background-color: #e6f3ff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 8px;"}

### Risk Statistics

| Intersectional Group | Year 1 Risk | Year 2 Risk | Critical Period | 11-Year Retention |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Black × Male × Non-ITT × London | 18% | 31% | Year 2 Crisis | 3.2% |
| Pakistani × Female × Non-ITT × North | 22% | 28% | Year 1 Crisis | 4.8% |
| White × Female × ITT × North | 8% | 10% | Gradual | 23.4% |

### Key Insight

::: {.callout-important}
**Transformative Insight**

Longitudinal MAIHDA reveals that "teacher retention" isn't one problem but many distinct challenges. Black male non-ITT teachers in London face a Year 2 crisis (HR = 2.8, 95% CrI: [2.1-3.7]), while Pakistani female non-ITT teachers in the North struggle most in Year 1. This enables precisely targeted, time-specific interventions.

# Study 3: London's Transport Policy {background-color="#7B3F99"}

## Current Approach: Policy Complexity {.smaller}

**Evaluating Complex Eligibility Criteria: Who Really Benefits?**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### London's Free Transport Policy:

::: {style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; font-size: 0.9em;"}
**Standard Eligibility:**

- Under 8: >2 miles to school
- 8+: >3 miles to school
- No safe walking route
- Special educational needs

**Low-Income Eligibility:**

- 8-11: >2 miles (nearest school)
- 11-16: 2-6 miles (3 nearest schools)
- 11-16: 2-15 miles (faith schools)
:::

### Current ABM Limitations:

- Models "average" low-income behavior
- Can't capture faith school preferences by ethnicity
- Misses intersectional barriers
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Hidden Complexity:

::: {.callout-tip}
**The Same Policy, Different Impacts:**

Example: 11-year-old, low-income, 4 miles from school
- ✓ White British: Likely uses local school (free transport)
- ✓ Pakistani Muslim: May prefer faith school 8 miles away (not covered)
- ✓ Black Caribbean: May avoid local "failing" school (complex choice)
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
**Research Gap:**
Current models simulate transport use but can't explain WHY different groups make different choices under the same policy
:::

### Key Questions ABM Can't Answer:

- Do faith school preferences create transport inequity?
- Which intersectional groups fall through eligibility gaps?
- How do cultural factors interact with distance rules?
:::
::::

::: {.callout-important}
**Critical Limitation**

Agent-based models treat policy eligibility as binary (yes/no) but can't reveal how intersectional identities shape actual benefit realization or uncover systematic exclusions
:::

## MAIHDA-Enhanced Policy Evaluation {.smaller}

**Revealing Who Benefits and Who's Left Behind**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### MAIHDA + ABM Integration:

- **MAIHDA:** Identifies differential policy impacts by intersectional group
- **ABM:** Simulates spatial dynamics and school competition
- **60 strata:** Ethnicity × Income × Car × Distance
- **Monte Carlo:** 10,000 policy scenarios

$$Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Eligible}) + \beta_2(\text{Distance}) + u_{1j}(\text{Policy} \times \text{Strata}) + (1|\text{LSOA}) + \varepsilon_{ij}$$

::: {style="background-color: #e6f3ff; padding: 12px; border-radius: 8px;"}
**Key Innovation:**
Reveals not just WHO is eligible, but who actually BENEFITS and WHY some eligible groups don't access support
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Differential Policy Realization:

| Intersectional Group | Eligible | Take-up | Impact |
|---------------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Pakistani × Low Income × 4mi | ✓ | 42% | +1.2 schools |
| White × Low Income × 4mi | ✓ | 78% | +3.1 schools |
| Black × Low Income × 2.5mi | ✗ | - | 0 schools |
| Pakistani × Low Income × Faith | ✓* | 68% | +4.8 schools |

### Monte Carlo Policy Refinements

::: {layout-ncol=3}
::: {style="background-color: #f0e6ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;"}
**Scenario A:** Reduce threshold to 2.5 miles for all  
→ 18,000 more eligible  
→ Reduces gap by 31%
:::

::: {style="background-color: #e6f3ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;"}
**Scenario B:** Cultural liaison for take-up  
→ Pakistani take-up: 42%→71%  
→ Most cost-effective
:::

::: {style="background-color: #ffe6e6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;"}
**Scenario C:** Expand faith provision  
→ Addresses preferences  
→ Reduces segregation 24%
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
**Transformative Finding**

MAIHDA reveals the policy works differently than intended - Pakistani families are eligible but face cultural/information barriers (42% take-up), while Black families in the 2.5-3 mile gap receive no support despite similar need. Monte Carlo simulations show targeted outreach would be 3x more cost-effective than expanding eligibility.
