What is MAIHDA? {background-color="#f0f0f0"}
Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy
::: {.callout-note}
The "Gold Standard" for Quantitative Intersectional Analysis
Treats intersectional identities as random effects in multilevel models, revealing how multiple characteristics combine to create unique experiences beyond simple additive effects
:::
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Conventional Approach:

Examines factors separately
Assumes additive effects
Misses critical intersections
Generic policy recommendations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
MAIHDA Approach:

Creates intersectional strata
Reveals multiplicative effects
Handles small cell sizes via shrinkage
Enables targeted interventions

Three Extended MAIHDA Applications:

Spatial MAIHDA → School Segregation Study
Longitudinal MAIHDA → Teacher Retention Study
Policy Evaluation MAIHDA → Transport & Accessibility Study
:::

Study 1: Educational Segregation {background-color="#7B3F99"}
Current Approach: Limitations {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Research Question
Which students experience educational segregation, and how does this vary across space and time?
::: {.callout-tip}
Current Aggregate Approach:

Calculates: Segregation indices by ethnicity and area
Shows: Overall levels of ethnic concentration in schools
Misses: Which specific students attend segregated schools
Cannot reveal: Intersectional vulnerabilities
:::

Current Method

Aggregate segregation indices
Treats ethnic groups as homogeneous
Cannot identify individual risk factors
Misses within-group heterogeneity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The Segregation Paradox
Aggregate data shows decreasing segregation, but which students still experience it?
::: {style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;"}
Who Attends Segregated Schools?
Current methods can't answer:

Are Pakistani boys more affected than Pakistani girls?
Does social class intersect with ethnicity?
Where do vulnerable groups cluster?
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Definition of Segregated School:
Schools where >70% of students are from a single ethnic group (following Burgess & Wilson, 2005)
:::
:::
::::
::: {.callout-important}
Limitation
Aggregate approaches hide intersectional experiences - we need individual-level analysis to understand WHO experiences segregation, not just HOW MUCH segregation exists
:::
Spatial MAIHDA Enhancement {.smaller}
Individual-Level Spatial MAIHDA Innovation
:::: {.columns}

Method Enhancement:

Unit: Individual students (N = 3.2 million)
Outcome: Attends segregated school (binary)
24 intersectional strata: Ethnicity × SES × Gender
Cross-classified with spatial units (LSOAs)
Monte Carlo: 10,000 simulations

logit(Y_ijk) = γ₀ + u₀j[strata] + v₀k[LSOA] + W*spatial_effects
Key Innovation: Reveals WHO is most likely to experience segregation, not just WHERE segregation exists

Critical Finding
Monte Carlo reveals Pakistani low-SES boys have 71.2% [95% CI: 68.4%-73.8%] probability of attending segregated schools, with strong spatial clustering (Moran's I = 0.82) in specific urban areas. This intersectional vulnerability was invisible in aggregate analyses.

Hidden Variation:

:::

Critical Limitation
These aggregate curves hide intersectional vulnerabilities. A Black male teacher without ITT in London has a fundamentally different trajectory than a White female teacher with ITT in rural areas - but current analysis treats them as parts of separate, additive categories.

Key Insight
::: {.callout-important}
Transformative Insight
Longitudinal MAIHDA reveals that "teacher retention" isn't one problem but many distinct challenges. Black male non-ITT teachers in London face a Year 2 crisis (HR = 2.8, 95% CrI: [2.1-3.7]), while Pakistani female non-ITT teachers in the North struggle most in Year 1. This enables precisely targeted, time-specific interventions.

London's Free Transport Policy:
::: {style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; font-size: 0.9em;"}
Standard Eligibility:

Under 8: >2 miles to school
8+: >3 miles to school
No safe walking route
Special educational needs

Low-Income Eligibility:

8-11: >2 miles (nearest school)
11-16: 2-6 miles (3 nearest schools)
11-16: 2-15 miles (faith schools)
:::

Current ABM Limitations:

Models "average" low-income behavior
Can't capture faith school preferences by ethnicity
Misses intersectional barriers
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Hidden Complexity:
::: {.callout-tip}
The Same Policy, Different Impacts:
Example: 11-year-old, low-income, 4 miles from school
✓ White British: Likely uses local school (free transport)
✓ Pakistani Muslim: May prefer faith school 8 miles away (not covered)
✓ Black Caribbean: May avoid local "failing" school (complex choice)
:::
::: {.callout-warning}
Research Gap:
Current models simulate transport use but can't explain WHY different groups make different choices under the same policy
:::
Key Questions ABM Can't Answer:

Do faith school preferences create transport inequity?
Which intersectional groups fall through eligibility gaps?
How do cultural factors interact with distance rules?
:::

::::
::: {.callout-important}
Critical Limitation
Agent-based models treat policy eligibility as binary (yes/no) but can't reveal how intersectional identities shape actual benefit realization or uncover systematic exclusions

Scenario A: Reduce threshold to 2.5 miles for all

→ Reduces gap by 31%
:::
::: {style="background-color: #e6f3ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;"}
Scenario B: Cultural liaison for take-up

Transformative Finding
MAIHDA reveals the policy works differently than intended - Pakistani families are eligible but face cultural/information barriers (42% take-up), while Black families in the 2.5-3 mile gap receive no support despite similar need. Monte Carlo simulations show targeted outreach would be 3x more cost-effective than expanding eligibility.
