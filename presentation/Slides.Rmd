# What is MAIHDA?

## Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy

**The "Gold Standard" for Quantitative Intersectional Analysis**

Treats intersectional identities as random effects in multilevel models, revealing how multiple characteristics combine to create unique experiences beyond simple additive effects.

## Conventional Approach vs MAIHDA Approach:

| Conventional | MAIHDA |
|--------------|---------|
| Examines factors separately | Creates intersectional strata |
| Assumes additive effects | Reveals multiplicative effects |
| Misses critical intersections | Handles small cell sizes via shrinkage |
| Generic policy recommendations | Enables targeted interventions |

## Three Extended MAIHDA Applications:
- **Spatial MAIHDA** → School Segregation Study
- **Longitudinal MAIHDA** → Teacher Retention Study
- **Policy Evaluation MAIHDA** → Transport & Accessibility Study

# Study 1: Educational Segregation - Current Approach

## Research Question
Which students experience educational segregation, and how does this vary across space and time?

## Current Aggregate Approach:
- **Calculates:** Segregation indices by ethnicity and area
- **Shows:** Overall levels of ethnic concentration in schools
- **Misses:** Which specific students attend segregated schools
- **Cannot reveal:** Intersectional vulnerabilities

## The Segregation Paradox
Aggregate data shows decreasing segregation, but which students still experience it?

**Who Attends Segregated Schools?**  
Current methods can't answer:
- Are Pakistani boys more affected than Pakistani girls?
- Does social class intersect with ethnicity?
- Where do vulnerable groups cluster?

**Definition:** Segregated School = Schools where >70% of students are from a single ethnic group

\newpage

# Study 1: Spatial MAIHDA Enhancement

## Individual-Level Spatial MAIHDA Innovation

**Method Enhancement:**
- Unit: Individual students (N = 3.2 million)
- Outcome: Attends segregated school (binary)
- 24 intersectional strata: Ethnicity × SES × Gender
- Cross-classified with spatial units (LSOAs)
- Monte Carlo: 10,000 simulations

**Model:** `logit(Y_ijk) = γ₀ + u₀j[strata] + v₀k[LSOA] + W*spatial_effects`

## Probability of Attending Segregated School:

| Intersectional Group | Probability | Odds Ratio |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Pakistani × Low SES × Male | **71.2%** | 3.57 [3.18-3.99] |
| Pakistani × Low SES × Female | **68.4%** | 3.24 [2.89-3.61] |
| Black × Low SES × Male | 52.3% | 2.48 [2.21-2.78] |
| White × High SES × Female | 21.1% | Reference |

**Discriminatory Accuracy:** ICC = 0.15  
85% of variation is within intersectional groups - context matters more than identity alone

## Spatial Clustering
- **Bradford:** 72% risk
- **Birmingham:** 69% risk
- **East London:** 74% risk
- **Moran's I = 0.82** (strong spatial clustering)

**Critical Finding:** Monte Carlo reveals Pakistani low-SES boys have 71.2% [95% CI: 68.4%-73.8%] probability of attending segregated schools, with strong spatial clustering in specific urban areas.

\newpage

# Study 2: Teacher Retention - Current Approach

## Tracking the 2011 Teacher Cohort: Traditional Survival Analysis

**Current Method Limitations:**
- Cox model with additive effects
- Assumes: ethnicity + gender + ITT = risk
- Misses intersectional experiences
- Cannot identify time-specific vulnerabilities

## Hidden Variation:
- **Female: 16.54%** - but ranges from 8% to 24% by intersectional group
- **No ITT: 9.75%** - but some groups retain at 18%, others at 3%

## 11-Year Retention Rates:
- Female: 16.54%
- Male: 9.75%
- With ITT: 16.85%
- No ITT: 9.75%

Female teacher retention ranges from 8% to 24% across intersectional groups!

**Critical Limitation:** These aggregate curves hide intersectional vulnerabilities. A Black male teacher without ITT in London has a fundamentally different trajectory than a White female teacher with ITT in rural areas.

\newpage

# Study 2: Longitudinal MAIHDA Enhancement

## Revealing Intersectional Career Trajectories

**Longitudinal MAIHDA Innovation:**
- 200 intersectional strata: Ethnicity × Gender × ITT × Region
- Time-varying hazards: Captures non-linear career patterns
- Individual trajectories: Random slopes for each stratum
- Critical periods: Statistically identified vulnerability windows

**Model:** `logit(leaving) ~ poly(year,2) + (poly(year,2)|strata) + (1|school) + (1|teacher)`

**Key Finding:** 78% of variation is within intersectional groups - individual context dominates

## Retention Statistics by Intersectional Group:

| Group | Year 1 Risk | Year 2 Risk | Critical Period | 11-Year Retention |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Black × Male × Non-ITT × London | 18% | **31%** | Year 2 Crisis | 3.2% |
| Pakistani × Female × Non-ITT × North | **22%** | 28% | Year 1 Crisis | 4.8% |
| White × Female × ITT × North | 8% | 10% | Gradual | 23.4% |

**Transformative Insight:** Longitudinal MAIHDA reveals that "teacher retention" isn't one problem but many distinct challenges. Black male non-ITT teachers in London face a Year 2 crisis (HR = 2.8, 95% CrI: [2.1-3.7]).

# Study 3: London's Free School Transport Policy

## Evaluating Complex Eligibility Criteria: Who Really Benefits?

**London's Free Transport Policy:**

**Standard Eligibility:**
- Under 8: >2 miles to school
- 8+: >3 miles to school
- No safe walking route
- Special educational needs

**Low-Income Eligibility:**
- 8-11: >2 miles (nearest school)
- 11-16: 2-6 miles (3 nearest schools)
- 11-16: 2-15 miles (faith schools)

## The Same Policy, Different Impacts:

Example: 11-year-old, low-income, 4 miles from school
- **White British:** Likely uses local school (free transport)
- **Pakistani Muslim:** May prefer faith school 8 miles away (not covered)
- **Black Caribbean:** May avoid local "failing" school (complex choice)

**Research Gap:** Current models simulate transport use but can't explain WHY different groups make different choices under the same policy

\newpage

# Study 3: MAIHDA-Enhanced Policy Evaluation

## Revealing Who Benefits and Who's Left Behind

**MAIHDA + ABM Integration:**
- MAIHDA: Identifies differential policy impacts by intersectional group
- ABM: Simulates spatial dynamics and school competition
- 60 strata: Ethnicity × Income × Car × Distance
- Monte Carlo: 10,000 policy scenarios

## Eligibility ≠ Access:

| Intersectional Group | Eligible | Take-up | Impact |
|---------------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Pakistani × Low Income × 4mi | Yes | 42% | +1.2 schools |
| White × Low Income × 4mi | Yes | 78% | +3.1 schools |
| Black × Low Income × 2.5mi | No | - | **0 schools** |
| Pakistani × Low Income × Faith | Yes* | 68% | +4.8 schools |

*Eligible for faith school provision (2-15 miles)

## Monte Carlo Policy Refinements:
- **Scenario A:** Reduce threshold to 2.5 miles → 18,000 more eligible, reduces gap by 31%
- **Scenario B:** Cultural liaison for take-up → Pakistani take-up: 42%→71%, most cost-effective
- **Scenario C:** Expand faith provision → Addresses preferences, reduces segregation 24%

**Transformative Finding:** Pakistani families are eligible but face cultural/information barriers (42% take-up), whilst Black families in the 2.5-3 mile gap receive no support. Targeted outreach would be 3x more cost-effective than expanding eligibility.

# MAIHDA: Transforming Understanding of Educational Inequalities

## Evolution Across Three Studies

| Study | Current Method | MAIHDA Extension | Key Innovation |
|-------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **School Segregation** | Aggregate Indices | Spatial MAIHDA | Reveals which intersectional groups experience segregation & where they cluster |
| **Teacher Retention** | Survival Analysis | Longitudinal MAIHDA | Identifies career crisis points for specific groups |
| **Transport Access** | Agent-Based Model | Policy Evaluation MAIHDA | Quantifies differential policy impacts |

## Contributing to Sheffield's MAIHDA Leadership

**Methodological Innovation:**
- Extending MAIHDA to spatial, longitudinal, and policy domains
- Monte Carlo uncertainty quantification
- Large dataset expertise (NPD, SWC)

**Why MAIHDA Matters:**
- Identifies WHO needs help (intersections)
- Shows WHERE to intervene (spatial)
- Reveals WHEN to act (temporal)
- Quantifies WHAT WORKS (policy)

## Vision
Advancing intersectional quantitative methods to reveal not just that inequalities exist, but precisely **where**, **for whom**, **when**, and **why** – transforming our ability to design interventions that actually work
